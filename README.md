# Election_Anlysis
## Project Overview
I was given the task of completing the election audit for a Colorado Board of Elections employee after a recent local election.
##Objectives
1.	Calculate the number of votes cast.
2.	Get a list of all candidates that had received votes.
3.	Calculate the total votes that each candidate had received
4.	Calculate the percentage of the votes that each candidate received
5.	Determine the winner of the election using popular vote
## Resources
-Data Source: election_results.csv
-Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.6.6
## Summary
The election analysis shows that:
-There were 369,711 total votes cast
-The Candidates were	-Charles Casper Stockham
	-Diana DeGette
	-Raymon Anthony Doane
-The candidate results were 
-Charles Casper Stockham received 23% of the votes and 85,213 total votes
-Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 total votes
-Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the votes and 11606 total votes
-The Winner of this elections was 
	-Diana DeGette: who received 73.8% of the votes and 242,892 total votes
## Challenge Overview
-	Overall this challenge was able to show how well each of the candidates did in a side by side comparison. I used the provided excel workbook for the data and used Visual Studio Code with Python to create a visual representation of the data. Having a visual summary of the data makes it much easier to determine, candidates, how much of the vote they won and their total votes won. 
## Challenge Summary
-	This election analysis shows that Diana DeGette came out as the top candidate with 73.8% of the total votes cast. By using Visual Studio Code I was able to compile the excel worksheet into a clear winner .
